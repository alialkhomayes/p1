you need to click on the button on the top right corner
that says "employee page"
after that you can see the icons and their names

for tickets, subscriptions and orders the "edit" button"
has no functionality for now because the project is only front end
but after we start using javascript the button should function as an 
edit for employees to manage tickets, subscriptions or orders by 
responding to the customers
